Welcome to SPEC ACCEL

The documentation, including the installation guides, can be
viewed using a web browser, either in the Docs directory, or on
the web at http://www.spec.org/accel/Docs/

If you do not have a browser handy, text copies of the
documentation are in the directory Docs.txt, but be warned: the
text copies are less readable than the html copies.

Installation pre-requisites are listed in:
    system-requirements.html

The installation guides are:
   install-guide-unix.html      Unix, Mac OS X
   install-guide-windows.html   Microsoft Windows

Please don't just blindly type "install".  On Windows, you may
need to add information about directories.  On both Windows and
Unix, you need to check the pre-requisites.

Furthermore, Windows testing has been very limited.  The benchmark
tools install, but there have been issues getting successful runs on
Windows.
