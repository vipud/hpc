"Compiler Notes"

"The AMD64 AOCC Compiler Suite is available at"
http://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/

"The AOCC Gold Linker plugin was installed and used for the link stage."

"The AOCC Fortran Plugin version 1.3.0 was used to leverage AOCC optimizers"
"with gfortran. It is available here:"
http://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/

"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"'numactl' was used to bind copies to the cores."
"See the configuration file for details."

"Operating System Notes"

"'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set environment stack size"
"'ulimit -l 2097152' was used to set environment locked pages in memory limit"

"runspec command invoked through numactl i.e.:"
"numactl --interleave=all runspec <etc>"

"Set dirty_ratio=8 to limit dirty cache to 8% of memory"
"Set swappiness=1 to swap only if necessary"
"Set zone_reclaim_mode=1 to free local node memory and avoid remote memory"
"sync then drop_caches=3 to reset caches before invoking runcpu"

"dirty_ratio, swappiness, zone_reclaim_mode and drop_caches were"
"all set using privileged echo (e.g. echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness)."

"Transparent huge pages were enabled for this run (OS default)"
