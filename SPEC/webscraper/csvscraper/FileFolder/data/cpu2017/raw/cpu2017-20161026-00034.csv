"Platform Notes"


"   The System Under Test (SUT),"
"   ""1-chip VM with SPARC M7"","
"   contains:"
"    - 1 physical CPU chip"
"    - 256 virtual CPUs"
"    - 32 cores"
"    - 480 GB memory"
"    - OS: Oracle Solaris 11.3.10.5.0"

"   The SUT is managed by a HOST with:"
"    - OS: Oracle Solaris 11.3.5.1.0"
"    - Oracle VM Server for SPARC v3.3"
"      (included with Oracle Solaris)"
"   From the standpoint of the HOST, the SUT is:"
"    - A Logical Domain (LDom)"
"    - One CMIOU (CPU, Memory, IO unit), containing:"
"      - 1 SPARC M7 chip"
"      - 16x 32 GB memory DIMMs"
"        - 1x DIMM is reserved"
"        - Therefore the SUT sees 480 GB, not 512"

"   The HOST is part of an M7-16 server that has:"
"     - Sun System Firmware 9.5.2.g 2015/12/07 11:57"
"     - 16x CMIOUs"
"     - 4x Domain Configurable Units (DCUs)"
"        - Each DCU has 4x CMIOUs"
"        - Each DCU is a Physical Domain (PDom)"
"   From the standpoint of the M7-16, the HOST"
"   is one PDom containing one DCU."

"   Additional information about SUT, LDom, and"
"   PDom commands are in the platform flags file."
