"        ulimit -s unlimited"

"    BIOS Settings:"
"        AMI BIOS 08/31/2012"
"        Performance defaults loaded"
"Definition of environment variables:"
MP_BIND
"You can set MP_BIND to yes or y to bind processes or threads executing in a"
"parallel region to physical processor. Set it to no or n to disable such"
"binding. The default is to not bind processes to processors. This variable"
"is an execution-time environment variable interpreted by the PGI runtime"
"support libraries. It does not affect the behavior of the PGI compilers"
"in any way."
MP_SPIN
"When a thread executing in a parallel region enters a barrier, it spins on a"
"semaphore. You can use MP_SPIN to specify the number of times it checks the"
"semaphore before calling sched_yield() (on Linux or MAC OS X) or _sleep()"
"(on Windows). These calls cause the thread to be re-scheduled, allowing"
"other processes to run. The default value is 1000000."
