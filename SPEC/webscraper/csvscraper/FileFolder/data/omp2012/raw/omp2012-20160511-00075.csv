"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"For all benchmarks threads were bound to cores using"
"the following submit command:"
"    dplace -x2 $command"
"This binds threads in order of creation, beginning"
"with the master thread on logical cpu 0, the first slave"
"thread on logical cpu 1, and so on.  The -x2 flag instructs"
"dplace to skip placement of the lightweight OpenMP monitor"
"thread, which is created prior to the slave threads."
