"  Transparent Hugepages Enabled"
"Job Placement:"
"  Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set"
"  of nodes.  The base run used 12 ranks per socket and peak"
"  runs varied between 8 and 14 ranks per socket.  The total"
"  number of sockets and nodes used was constant."
"Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"  The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"  with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"  I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic can"
"  use both planes."
