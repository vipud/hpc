"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."

"General Notes"

" MPI startup command:"
"   mpirun command was used to start MPI jobs. This command starts"
"   an independent ring of mpd daemons, launches an MPI job, and shuts"
"   down the mpd ring upon the job termination."
"   The mpirun command automatically detects if an MPI job is submitted"
"   in a session allocated using a job scheduler (like PBS Pro). In this"
"   case, the mpirun command extracts the host list from the respective"
"   environment and uses these nodes automatically."

" BIOS settings:"
"   Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (SMT): Disabled (default is Enabled)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology (Turbo)  : Enabled (default is Enabled)"

" RAM configuration:"
"   Compute nodes have 1x4-GB RDIMM on each memory channel."

" Network:"
"   Forty six 36-port switches: 18 core switches and 28 leaf switches."
"   Each leaf has one link to each core. Remaining 18 ports on 25 of 28 leafs"
"   are used for compute nodes. On the remaining 3 leafs the ports are used"
"   for FS nodes and other peripherals."

" Job placement:"
"   Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set of nodes, i.e."
"   the minimal needed number of leaf switches was used for each job: 1 switch"
"   for 16/32/64/128 ranks, 2 switches for 256 ranks, 4 switches for 512 ranks."

" Fileserver:"
"   Intel SR1560SF systems connected via IB to DataDirect Networks S2A9900"
"   storage which is: 160 disks, 300GB/disk, 48TB total, 35TB available."

" PBS Pro was used for job submission. It has no impact on performance."
