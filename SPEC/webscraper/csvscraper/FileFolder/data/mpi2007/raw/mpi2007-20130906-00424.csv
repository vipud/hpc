" Transparent Hugepage: Disabled"

" Job Placement:"
"   Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set"
"   of nodes."

" Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"   The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"   with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"   I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic can"
"   use both planes."

" Peak run:"
"   In the peak run, some benchmarks used different number of ranks"
"   from base. It is the only difference between base and peak."
