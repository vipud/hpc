"General Notes"

" setenv MPI_DSM_DISTRIBUTE 1"
"      Ensures that each MPI process gets a unique CPU and physical"
"      memory on the node with which that CPU is associated.  The"
"      CPUs are chosen by simply starting at cpuset-relative CPU 0"
"      and incrementing until all MPI processes have been forked."
" setenv MPI_REQUEST_MAX 65536"
"      Determines the maximum number of nonblocking sends and"
"      receives that can simultaneously exist for any single MPI"
"      process.  MPI generates an error message if this limit"
"      (or the default, if not set) is exceeded.  Default:  16384"
" limit stacksize unlimited"
"      Removes limits on the maximum size of the automatically-"
"      extended stack region of the current process and each"
"      process it creates."
