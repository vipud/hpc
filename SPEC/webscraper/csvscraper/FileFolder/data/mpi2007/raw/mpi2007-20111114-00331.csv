"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"For benchmarks that used 2048 or 2560 MPI ranks, four ranks"
"were assigned to each CPU chip, leaving 2 cores per chip idle."

"General Notes"

" Software environment:"
"   export MPI_REQUEST_MAX=65536"
"   export MPI_TYPE_MAX=32768"
"   export MPI_BUFS_THRESHOLD=1"
"   export MPI_IB_RAILS=2"
"   ulimit -s unlimited"

" BIOS settings:"
"   AMI BIOS version 080016"
"   Hyper-Threading Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology activated in the OS via"
"     /etc/init.d/acpid start"
"     /etc/init.d/powersaved start"
"     powersave -f"

" Job Placement:"
"   In the run with 3072 and 4608 ranks, each MPI job was"
"   assigned to a topologically compact set of nodes with"
"   64 switches for 3072 ranks and 96 switches for 4608 ranks."
"   In the run with 2048 and 2560 MPI ranks, four ranks were"
"   assigned to each CPU chip, leaving 2 cores per chip idle."
"   There were 64 switches used for 2048 ranks and 80 switches"
"   used for 2560 ranks, with topology compact configurations"
"   in both cases."

" Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"   The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"   with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"   I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic can"
"   use both planes."

"   SGI manufactures its own switch blades using unmodified Mellanox"
"   switch ASICs. The test system has SGI QDR_1.5_HYPR_2454 switch"
"   with Mellanox 36-port QDR Infiniband switch Device 48438"
"   (InfiniScale IV)."
