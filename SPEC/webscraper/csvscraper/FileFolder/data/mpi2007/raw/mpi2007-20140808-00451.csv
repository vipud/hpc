"   export MPI_IB_RAILS=2"
"   export MPI_CONNECTIONS_THRESHOLD=0"

"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology activated with"
"     modprobe acpi_cpufreq"
"     cpupower frequency-set -u 2601MHz -d 2601MHz -g performance"

" Job Placement:"
"   Ten ranks were assigned to each CPU chip, leaving 2"
"   cores per chip idle. There were 30 switches used"
"   with a topologically compact configuration."

" Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"   The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"   with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"   I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic can"
"   use both planes."
