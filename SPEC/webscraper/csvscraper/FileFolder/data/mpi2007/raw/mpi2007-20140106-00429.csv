"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."

"General Notes"

"130.socorro (base): ""nullify_ptrs"" src.alt was used."

" Software environment:"
"   export MPI_REQUEST_MAX=65536"
"   export MPI_TYPE_MAX=32768"
"   export MPI_BUFS_THRESHOLD=1"
"   export MPI_IB_RAILS=2"

" BIOS settings:"
"   AMI BIOS version 3.0"
"   Hyper-Threading Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology activated in the OS via"
"     /etc/init.d/acpid start"
"     /etc/init.d/powersaved start"
"     powersave -f"

" Job Placement:"
"   Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set"
"   of nodes, i.e. the minimal needed number of switches was"
"   used for each job: 2 switches for up to 180 ranks,"
"   4 switches for up to 320 ranks, 8 switches for 640 ranks,"
"   10 switches for 800 ranks, 16 switches for 1280 ranks,"
"   22 switches for 1920 ranks, and 30 switches for 2560 ranks."

" Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"   The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"   with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"   I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic can"
"   use both planes."
