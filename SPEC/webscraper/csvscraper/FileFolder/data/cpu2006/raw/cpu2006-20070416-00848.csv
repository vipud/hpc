"Operating System Notes"


"  Processes were bound to cores using ""submit"" and ""pbind""."

" These shell commands request use of 4MB pages:"
"       export LD_PRELOAD=mpss.so.1"
"       export MPSSHEAP=4MB"
"       export MPSSSTACK=4MB"

"  ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space"
"  consumed by the stack (and therefore make more"
"  space available to the heap)."

"  The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"      svcadm disable webconsole"

"Platform Notes"


"""CPUM"" = CPU Module; each module holds two CPU chips."

"Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
"the same capacity DIMMs."

"This result was measured using a Sun SPARC Enterprise"
"M4000 Server.  Note that the Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise"
"M4000 and Sun SPARC Enterprise M4000 are electrically"
equivalent.
