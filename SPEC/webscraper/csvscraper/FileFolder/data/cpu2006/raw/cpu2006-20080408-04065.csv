"Compiler Invocation Notes"


" Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
" http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12_patches.jsp"
" The tested configuration included patch 124867-02, 124861-04, 124863-01"

" Peak also uses ""GCC for SPARC Systems"", which combines gcc"
" with the Sun Code Generator for SPARC systems.  It is invoked"
" as ""gcc"", and accepts source code compatible with GCC 4.2."
" For more information, including support, see"
"      http://cooltools.sunsource.net/gcc/"

"Operating System Notes"


" The Sun Blade 6000 was tested with 10x T6320 Modules,"
" each containing 1x UltraSPARC T2 chip."

" The Sun Blade T6320 is supported by Solaris 10 8/07"
" plus a factory-installed set of patches.  As tested, the"
" system used a 15 January 2008 pre-release build of the"
" patch set."

" OS and test harness settings include:"

" - On each T6320 Module:"
"     - The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"          svcadm disable webconsole"
"     - /etc/system settings:"
"          autoup = 600"
"          set bufhwm_pct=1"
"          set segmap_percent=2"
"          set tsb_rss_factor=128"
"          tune_t_fsflushr = 10"
"     - Process settings:"
"          ulimit -s 131072"

" - The ""submit"" feature was used with a perl procedure, which did"
"   arithmetic to derive processor numbers from the SPEC copy number"

" Additional details about the above points be found in the ""Platform"
" Settings"" section of the associated flags file."
