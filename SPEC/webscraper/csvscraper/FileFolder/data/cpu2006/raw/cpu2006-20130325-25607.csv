"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" The Apache C++ Standard Library V4.2.1 was installed from"

"      alias gmake=specmake"
"      gmake BUILDTYPE=8d CONFIG=sunpro.config"

"Submit Notes"

" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind' commands."
" The config file option 'submit' was used, along with a list of"
" processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate the pbind commands."
" (For details, please see the config file.)"

"Operating System Notes"

" Shell Environments:"
"    ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed by the stack"
"    (and therefore make more space available to the heap)."

"    The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using svcadm disable webconsole."

" System Tunables:"
" (/etc/system parameters)"
"    lpg_alloc_prefer=1"
"      Indicates that extra effort should be taken to ensure that pages are"
"      created in the nearby lgroup (NUMA location)."

"    dopageflush=0"
"      Controls whether memory is examined for modified pages during fsflush"
"      invocations. 0 means disabled."

"    doiflush=0"
"      Controls whether file system metadata syncs will be executed during fsflush"
