"  118683-05  119963-20  120753-08"
" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 and patches are available at"
"  http://oracle.com/goto/solarisstudio"

"Submit Notes"

"Processes were bound to cores using ""submit"" and ""pbind"".  The config"
"file option 'submit' was used in order to accomplish this."

"Operating System Notes"


"ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space"
"consumed by the stack (and therefore make more"
"space available to the heap)."

" /etc/system parameters"
"    autoup=600"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."
"    tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."
"    lpg_alloc_prefer=1"
"        Indicates that extra effort should be taken to ensure"
"        that pages are created in the nearby lgroup (NUMA location)."
"    tsb_rss_factor=128"
"        Suggests that the the size of the TSB (Translation"
"        Storage Buffer) may be increased if it is more than"
"        25% (128/512) full.  Doing so may reduce TSB traps,"
"        at the cost of additional kernel memory."
"    zfs:zfs_arc_max=0x10000000"
"    zfs:zfs_arc_min=0x10000000"
"        Limits the consumption of memory by the zfs file system"
"        cache to 256 MB.  (The arc_max sets the maximum cache"
"        size; arc_min sets the minimum.)"
"    zfs:zfs_prefetch_disable = 1"
"        Indicates that prefetching is not desired.  This setting"
"        may be desirable when the file system cache is small."
" USB devices were turned off with ILOM command"
"    set /SYS/MB/USB component_state=disabled"
" The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"
" The system had 271 GB of swap space."
