"Submit Notes"

" The config file option 'submit' was used"
" to assign benchmark copy to specific kernel thread using"
" the ""numactl"" command (see flags file for details)."

"Operating System Notes"

" ulimit -s (stack) set to unlimited"

" 8000 16M large pages defined"
" Transparent huge page disabled with"
" echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled"
" sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=N and reboot to set large page pool"

"This result uses the post_setup and/or bench_post_setup to drop caches. SPEC has"
"determined that although the effect may have been negligible for this run, future"
"submissions will not be considered rule compliant if the post_setup actions drop"
"caches (e.g. : ""echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"")."
