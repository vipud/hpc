"General Notes"


" All binaries were built with 32-bit Intel compiler except:"
" 401.bzip2 and 456.hmmer in peak were built with 64-bit Intel"
" compiler by changing the path for include and library files."

" BIOS configuration:"
" Hardware Prefetch = Disable, Adjacent Sector Prefetch = Disable"

" The PRIMERGY RX300 S3 and the PRIMERGY TX300 S3 are electronically equivalent."
