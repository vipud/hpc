"Operating System Notes"


"Processes were bound to cores using ""submit"" and ""pbind""."
"The SPEC toolset was bound to processor 0."

"These shell commands request use of local 4MB pages:"
"      export LD_PRELOAD=madv.so.1:mpss.so.1"
"      export MPSSHEAP=4MB"
"      export MPSSSTACK=4MB"
"      export MADV=access_lwp"
"'access_lwp' means that the next light weight"
"process to touch the specified address range"
"will access it the most heavily."

"ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space"
"consumed by the stack (and therefore make more"
"space available to the heap)."

" /etc/system parameters"
"    autoup=300"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."
"    bufhwm=3000"
"       Memory byte limit for caching I/O buffers"
"    segmap_percent=1"
"       Set maximum percent memory for file system cache"
"    tune_t_fsflushr=3"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."

" The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"

"Platform Notes"


"Disk notes: The SPEC CPU tests use a 400 GB partition"
"created from 3x Sun StorageTek 6140 stripe sets.  The"
"partition was created in 3 steps: 1. Each 6140 stripe"
"set (RAID 0) is based on 8x 146 GB 15,000 RPM Seagate"
"ST3146954FC FC-AL disks.  2. Solaris views these as 3"
"logical units (LUNs) which are striped together (RAID"
"0) to make a 3 TB volume using Solaris Volume Manager"
"(SVM).  3. Lastly, SVM is then used to create one 400"
"GB soft partition for use by the CPU2006 output_root."

"""CMU"" = CPU/Memory Unit; each holds 2 or 4 CPU chips."

"Memory was 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
"the same capacity DIMMs."

"This result was measured using a Sun SPARC Enterprise"
"M8000 Server.  Note that the Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise"
"M8000 and Sun SPARC Enterprise M8000 are electrically"
equivalent.
