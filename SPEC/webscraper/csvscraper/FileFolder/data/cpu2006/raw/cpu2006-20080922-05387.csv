"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" All binaries were built with 64-bit mode except:"
" 437.leslie3d, 450.soplex and 482.sphinx3 in peak"
" were built with 32-bit mode."

"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
" taskset has been used to bind processes to cores except"
" for 436.cactusADM peak"
" For peak modules using 1/2 the number of available cores,"
" each copy was assigned to a single L2 cache using mysubmit.pl script."
" See the flags description file for mysubmit.pl details."
