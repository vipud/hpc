" Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
"   http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12u1_patches.jsp"

"Submit Notes"


" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind'"
" commands.  The config file option 'submit' was used, along"
" with a list of processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate"
" the pbind commands.  (For details, please see the config file.)"

" Other System Settings:"

" The webconsole service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"

"Platform Notes"


" Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
" the same capacity DIMMs."

" This result is measured on a Sun SPARC Enterprise M8000"
" Server.  The Sun SPARC Enterprise M8000 and the Fujitsu"
" SPARC Enterprise M8000 are electrically equivalent."

"   SUNW_MP_THR_IDLE = ""SPIN"""
"(Although these variables were set prior to the run"
"they did not affect performance, since the benchmarks"
"were compiled in serial mode.)"
