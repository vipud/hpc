"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
" http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12_patches.jsp"
" The tested configuration included patch 124867-05,"
" 124861-06, 124863-04, 127000-04"

" Peak also uses ""GCC for SPARC Systems"", which combines gcc"
" with the Sun Code Generator for SPARC systems.  It is invoked"
" as ""gcc"", and accepts source code compatible with GCC 4.2."
" For more information, including support, see"
"    http://cooltools.sunsource.net/gcc/"

"Submit Notes"

" The config file option 'submit' was used.  Processes were"
" bound to cores using ""submit"" and ""pbind""."

"Operating System Notes"


" ulimit -s 131072 was used to allow the stack to grow"
" up to 131072 KB (aka 128 MB).  Note that saying ""131072"""
" is preferable to ""unlimited"", because there is a tradeoff"
" between space for the stack vs. space for the heap."

" /etc/system parameters"
"    autoup=600"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."
"    bufhwm=3000"
"       Memory byte limit for caching I/O buffers"
"    segmap_percent=1"
"       Set maximum percent memory for file system cache"
"    tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."
"    tsb_rss_factor=128"
"       Suggests that the the size of the TSB (Translation Storage Buffer)"
"       may be increased if it is more than 25% (128/512) full.  Doing so"
"       may reduce TSB traps, at the cost of additional kernel memory."

" The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"    svcadm disable webconsole"

" The system had 168 GB of swap space."
