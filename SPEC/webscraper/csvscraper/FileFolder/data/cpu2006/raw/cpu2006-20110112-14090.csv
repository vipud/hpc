"  118683-05  119963-20  120753-08"
" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 and patches are available at"

"Submit Notes"

"Processes were bound to cores using ""submit"" and ""pbind"".  The config"
"file option 'submit' was used in order to accomplish this."

"Operating System Notes"


"ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space"
"consumed by the stack (and therefore make more"
"space available to the heap)."

" /etc/system parameters"
"    autoup=600"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."
"    tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."
"    lpg_alloc_prefer=1"
"        Indicates that extra effort should be taken to ensure"
"        that pages are created in the nearby lgroup (NUMA location)."
"    tsb_rss_factor=128"
"        Suggests that the the size of the TSB (Translation"
"        Storage Buffer) may be increased if it is more than"
"        25% (128/512) full.  Doing so may reduce TSB traps,"
"        at the cost of additional kernel memory."
"    zfs:zfs_arc_max=0x10000000"
"    zfs:zfs_arc_min=0x10000000"
"        Limits the consumption of memory by the zfs file system"

"        size; arc_min sets the minimum.)"
"    zfs:zfs_prefetch_disable = 1"
"        Indicates that prefetching is not desired.  This setting"
"        may be desirable when the file system cache is small."
" USB devices were turned off with ILOM command"
"    set /SYS/MB/USB component_state=disabled"
" The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"
" The system had 437 GB of swap space."
