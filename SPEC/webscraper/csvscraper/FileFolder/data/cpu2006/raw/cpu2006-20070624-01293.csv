" The system bus runs at 1066 MHz"
" All binaries were built with 64-bit Intel compiler except:"
" 433.milc, 434.zeusmp, 450.soplex, 470.lbm and 482.sphinx3 in peak were built with"
" 32-bit Intel compiler by changing the path for include and library files."

" The Express5800/120Rg-1 and the Express5800/120Ri-2 models are"
" electronically equivalent."
" The results have been measured on a Express5800/120Ri-2 model."
