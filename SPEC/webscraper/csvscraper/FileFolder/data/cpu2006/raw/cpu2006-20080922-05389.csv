"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" All binaries were built with 64-bit mode except:"
" 437.leslie3d, 450.soplex and 482.sphinx3 in peak"
" were built with 32-bit mode."

"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
" taskset has been used to bind processes to cores except"
" for 436.cactusADM peak"
" For peak modules using 1/2 the number of available cores,"
" each copy was assigned to a single L2 cache using mysubmit.pl script."
" See the flags description file for mysubmit.pl details."

"Operating System Notes"

" 'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set the stacksize to unlimited prior to run"
" OMP_NUM_THREADS set to number of cores (default)"
" KMP_AFFINITY set to ""physical,0"""
" KMP_STACKSIZE set to 64M"
