"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" The Apache C++ Standard Library V4.2.1 was installed from"

"      alias gmake=specmake"
"      gmake BUILDTYPE=8d CONFIG=sunpro.config"

"Submit Notes"

" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind' commands."
" The config file option 'submit' was used, along with a list of"
" processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate the pbind commands."
" (For details, please see the config file.)"

"Operating System Notes"

" Shell Environments:"
"    ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed by the stack"
"    (and therefore make more space available to the heap)."

"    The ""Logical Domains Manager"" service was turned off using the command ""svcadm disable ldmd""."

" System Tunables:"
" (/etc/system parameters)"
"    autoup = 1555200"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to be written by fsflush."
"    tune_t_fsflushr = 259200"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the page flush daemon, fsflush."
