"Compiler Invocation Notes"


" Sun Studio 12 Update 1 pre-release build 41.1 was used."


"Submit Notes"


" A processor set was created using"
"   psrset -c 1-255"
" and the runspec process was placed into the set using"
"   psrset -e 1"
" The config file option 'submit' was used to select specific"
" processors within the set, along with the pbind command."

"Operating System Notes"


" ulimit -s 131072 was used to allow the stack to grow"
" up to 131072 KB (aka 128 MB).  Note that saying ""131072"""
" is preferable to ""unlimited"", because there is a tradeoff"
" between space for the stack vs. space for the heap."


" /etc/system parameters"
"    autoup=600"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."
"    tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."
"    tsb_rss_factor=128"
"       Suggests that the the size of the TSB (Translation Storage Buffer)"
"       may be increased if it is more than 25% (128/512) full.  Doing so"
"       may reduce TSB traps, at the cost of additional kernel memory."
"    zfs:zfs_arc_max = 0x10000000"
"       Limits the consumption of memory by the zfs file system"

" The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"

" The system had 229 GB of swap space."

"Platform Notes"


" This result was measured on a Sun SPARC Enterprise T5440."
" The Sun SPARC Enterprise T5440 and the Fujitsu SPARC"
" Enterprise T5440 are electrically equivalent."
