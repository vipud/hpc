"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 is distributed with mandatory OS patches"
"  118683-05  119963-20  120753-08"
" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 and patches are available at"
"  http://oracle.com/goto/solarisstudio"

"Submit Notes"


" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind'"
" commands.  The config file option 'submit' was used, along"
" with a list of processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate"
" the pbind commands.  (For details, please see the config file.)"


"Operating System Notes"

" ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space"
" consumed by the stack (and therefore make more"
" space available to the heap)."

"  /etc/system parameters"
"     autoup=600"
"        Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"        be written by fsflush."
"     tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"        Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"        page flush daemon, fsflush."
"     zfs:zfs_arc_min=0x10000000"
"     zfs:zfs_arc_max=0x380000000"
"        Limits the consumption of memory by the zfs file system"
"        cache to 256 MB to 14 GB .  (The arc_max sets the maximum"
"        cache size; arc_min sets the minimum.)"
"     kernel_cage_enable=0"
"        Allows the kernel to use memory in any locality group."
"        In particular, allows ZFS file caches to be located on"
"        any memory board."
"     lpg_alloc_prefer=1"
"         Indicates that extra effort should be taken to ensure"
"         that pages are created in the nearby lgroup (NUMA location)."
"  The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"      svcadm disable webconsole"
"  The system had 52 GB of swap space."

"Platform Notes"


" Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
" the same capacity DIMMs."

" This result is measured on a SPARC Enterprise M5000 server from"
" Oracle.  The SPARC Enterprise M5000 server from Oracle and from"
" Fujitsu are electrically equivalent."
