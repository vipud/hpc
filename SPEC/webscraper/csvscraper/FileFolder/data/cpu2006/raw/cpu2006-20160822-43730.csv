"Submit Notes"

" The dplace mechanism was used to bind copies to processors. The config file option 'submit'"
" was used to generate dplace commands to bind each copy to a specific processor."
" Benchmark copies were launched in a staggered fashion to minimize kernel contention"
" associated with synchronized launches."
" For details, please see the config file."
