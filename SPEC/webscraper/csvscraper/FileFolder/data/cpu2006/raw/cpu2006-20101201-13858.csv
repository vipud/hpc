"    ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed"
"    by the stack.(making more space available for the heap)"

" System Tunables (/etc/system parameters):"

" autoup=600"
"     Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"     be written by fsflush."
" zfs:zfs_arc_max = 0x10000000"
"     Control the amount of memory used by ZFS for caching"
