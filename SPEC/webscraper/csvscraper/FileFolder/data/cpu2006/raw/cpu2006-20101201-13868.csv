"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 is distributed with mandatory OS patches"
"  118683-05  119963-20  120753-08"
" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 and patches are available at"
"  http://oracle.com/goto/solarisstudio"

"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used.  Processes were assigned to"
"specific processors using 'pbind' commands.  The list of processors to use"
"was provided in the 'BIND' variable, to generate the pbind commands."
"(For details, please see the config file.)"

"Operating System Notes"


"Shell Environments:"

"    ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed"
"    by the stack.(making more space available for the heap)"

" System Tunables (/etc/system parameters):"

" autoup=600"
"     Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"     be written by fsflush."
" zfs:zfs_arc_max = 0x10000000"
"     Control the amount of memory used by ZFS for caching"
" lpg_alloc_prefer=1"
"     Prefer local pages, even if not easily available"

" Other System Settings:"

" The webconsole service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"


"Platform Notes"


" Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling each CMU's slots with the same"
" capacity DIMMs."

" This result is measured on a SPARC Enterprise M8000 server from"
" Fujitsu.  The SPARC Enterprise M8000 server from Oracle and from"
" Fujitsu are electrically equivalent."
