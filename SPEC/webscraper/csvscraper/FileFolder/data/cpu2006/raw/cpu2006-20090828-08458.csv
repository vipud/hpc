"      vSMP Foundation: 2.0.65.35"
"  Other Cache:"
"     ScaleMP vSMP Foundation manages cache coherency between the"
"     InfiniBand-connected systems via multiple concurrent memory"
"     coherency mechanisms, on a per-block basis, based on"
"     real-time memory activity access patterns."
"     This mechanism reserves 92 GB of the main memory across all"
"     boards (distributed), which is used as a 4th level cache."
"  Hardware Details:"
"     System was aggregated using 16 X Dell PowerEdge M610."
"     The servers were connected with Melanox InfiniBand QDR and a"
"     QDR switch."
"  CPU Characteristics: Intel Turbo Boost Technology not-enabled:"
"     As the prerequisites listed below for enablement of this"
"     technology did not exist."
"     The prerequisites for Turbo Boost Technology are:"
"     - Hardware: Enabling Turbo Boost Technology require BIOS setting."
"     - Software: OS needs to be ACPI-aware and set P0 power state."
