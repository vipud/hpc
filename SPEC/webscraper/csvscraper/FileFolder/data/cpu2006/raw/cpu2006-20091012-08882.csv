"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" Sun Studio 12 Update 1 was used, plus patch 119963-17"

" Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
"   http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12u1_patches.jsp"

"Submit Notes"


" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind'"
" commands.  The config file option 'submit' was used, along"
" with a list of processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate"
" the pbind commands.  (For details, please see the config file.)"


"Operating System Notes"


" ulimit -s 131072 was used to allow the stack to grow"
" up to 131072 KB (aka 128 MB).  Note that saying ""131072"""
" is preferable to ""unlimited"", because there is a tradeoff"
" between space for the stack vs. space for the heap."


" System Tunables (/etc/system parameters):"

" tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"     Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"     page flush daemon, fsflush."
" autoup=600"
"     Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"     be written by fsflush."
" zfs:zfs_arc_max = 0x10000000"
"     Control the amount of memory used by ZFS for caching"
" lpg_alloc_prefer=1"
"     Prefer local pages, even if not easily available"

" Other System Settings:"

" The webconsole service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"

" The system had 50 GB of swap space"

"Platform Notes"


" Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
" the same capacity DIMMs."

" This result is measured on a Sun SPARC Enterprise M5000"
" Server.  The Sun SPARC Enterprise M5000 and the Fujitsu"
" SPARC Enterprise M5000 are electrically equivalent."


"General Notes"

" Environment variables set by runspec before the start of the run:"
"    OMP_NUM_THREADS = ""64"""
"    SUNW_MP_PROCBIND = ""true"""
"    SUNW_MP_THR_IDLE = ""SPIN"""
"(Although these variables were set prior to the run"
"they did not affect performance, since the benchmarks"
"were compiled in serial mode.)"
