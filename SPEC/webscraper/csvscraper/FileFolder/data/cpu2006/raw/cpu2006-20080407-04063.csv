"Compiler Invocation Notes"

"Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12_patches.jsp
"The tested configuration included patch 124867-02, 124861-04,"
"124863-01, 127000-01"
"Peak also uses ""GCC for SPARC Systems"", which combines gcc"
"with the Sun Code Generator for SPARC systems.  It is invoked"
"as ""gcc"", and accepts source code compatible with GCC 4.2."
"For more information, including support, see"
"     http://cooltools.sunsource.net/gcc/"

"Operating System Notes"

"Processes were bound to cores using ""submit"" and ""pbind""."
"A processor set was created using"
"  psrset -c 1-127"
"and the runspec process was placed into the set using"
"  psrset -e 1"

"These shell commands request use of local 4MB pages:"
"     export LD_PRELOAD=madv.so.1:mpss.so.1"
"     export MPSSHEAP=4MB"
"     export MPSSSTACK=4MB"
"     export MADV=access_lwp"
"'access_lwp' means that the next light weight"
"process to touch the specified address range"
"will access it the most heavily."

"ulimit -s 131072 was used to allow the stack to grow"
"up to 131072 KB (aka 128 MB).  Note that saying ""131072"""
"is preferable to ""unlimited"", because there is a tradeoff"
"between space for the stack vs. space for the heap."

"The open file limit was set to 1300 with ulimit -n"

"/etc/system parameters"
"   autoup=600"
"      Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"      be written by fsflush."
"   bufhwm=3000"
"      Memory byte limit for caching I/O buffers"
"   segmap_percent=1"
"      Set maximum percent memory for file system cache"
"   tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"      Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"      page flush daemon, fsflush."
"   tsb_rss_factor=128"
"      Suggests that the the size of the TSB (Translation Storage Buffer)"
"      may be increased if it is more than 25% (128/512) full.  Doing so"
"      may reduce TSB traps, at the cost of additional kernel memory."

"The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"    svcadm disable webconsole"

"The system had 144 GB of swap space."

"Platform Notes"


" This result was measured on a Sun SPARC Enterprise T5240."
" The Sun SPARC Enterprise T5240 and the Fujitsu SPARC"
" Enterprise T5240 are electrically equivalent."
