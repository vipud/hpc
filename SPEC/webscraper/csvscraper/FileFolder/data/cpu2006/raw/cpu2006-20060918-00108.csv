"General Notes"

" Environment stack size set to 'unlimited'"
" For parallel runs (those compiled with ""-Mconcur"")"
" the following environment variables were set:"
"   NCPUS = 2"
"   MP_BIND = yes"
"   MP_BLIST = 1,0"

" NCPUS=n sets the number of threads to use to ""n""."
" MP_BIND=yes instructs the runtime to bind a thread to a core."
" MP_BLIST defines the thread-core relationship."
" The 4 1GB memory modules populated the first DIMM socket"
" of each channel (0-3)."
