"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 is distributed with mandatory OS patches"
"  118683-05  119963-20  120753-08"
" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 and patches are available at"
"  http://oracle.com/goto/solarisstudio"

"Submit Notes"


" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind'"
" commands.  The config file option 'submit' was used, along"
" with a list of processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate"
" the pbind commands.  (For details, please see the config file.)"


"Operating System Notes"


"Shell Environments:"

"    ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed"
"    by the stack.(making more space available for the heap)"

"System Tunables:"
"(/etc/system parameters)"

"    tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."
"    autoup=600"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."

"Other System Settings:"

"    The webconsole service was turned off using svcadm disable webconsole."

"Platform Notes"


" Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
" the same capacity DIMMs."

" This result is measured on a SPARC Enterprise M4000 server from"
" Fujitsu.  The SPARC Enterprise M4000 server from Oracle and from"
" Fujitsu are electrically equivalent."
