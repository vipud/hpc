" The system bus runs at 1333 MHz"

" All binaries were built with 64-bit Intel compiler except:"
" 433.milc, 434.zeusmp, 450.soplex, 470.lbm and 482.sphinx3 in peak were built with"
" 32-bit Intel compiler by changing the path for include and library files."

" This result was measured on the PRIMERGY RX300 S3. The PRIMERGY RX300 S3 and"
" the PRIMERGY TX300 S3 are electronically equivalent."
