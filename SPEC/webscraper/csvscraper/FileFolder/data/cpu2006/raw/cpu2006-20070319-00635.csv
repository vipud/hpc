"Platform Notes"

"BIOS default settings have been used, except:"
"Snoop Filter Enabled"
"  (The Snoop Filter is designed to reduce system bus utilization coming"
"  from cache misses. It can lead to significant memory performance"
"  improvements for several workstation applications on suitable memory"
"  configurations.)"
"Adjacent Cache Line Prefetch Enabled"
"  (Prefetches a cache line pair of data instead of only the cache line"
"  that contains the requested data. This helps to improve data access time"
"  for some applications, especially for single processors.)"
