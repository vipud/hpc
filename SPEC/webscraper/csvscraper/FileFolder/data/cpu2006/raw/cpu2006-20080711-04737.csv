"Compiler Invocation Notes"

"Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
"    http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12_patches.jsp"

"Submit Notes"


"Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind' commands.  The config"
"file option 'submit' was used, along with a list of processors in the 'BIND'"
"variable, to generate the pbind commands.  (For details, please see the config file.)"


"Operating System Notes"


"Environment Variable Settings:"

"export LD_PRELOAD=mpss.so.1:madv.so.1"
"export MPSSHEAP=4MB"
"export MPSSSTACK=4MB"
"    Requests system to use 4 MB pages when possible."
"export MADV access_lwp"
"    access_lwp requests that the next light weight process to touch"
"    the specified address range will access it most heavily."
"ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed"
"    by the stack (making more space available for the heap)"

"System Tunables (/etc/system parameters):"

autoup=200
"    Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"    be written by fsflush."
lpg_alloc_prefer=1
"    Set lgroup page allocation to strongly prefer local pages"

"Other System Settings:"

"The webconsole service was turned off using"
"    svcadm disable webconsole"

"The SPEC toolset was bound to processors 1-511 using processor sets:"
"    psrset -c 1-511"
"    psrset -e 1 ksh"


"Platform Notes"


"Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
"the same capacity DIMMs."

"This result is measured on a Sun SPARC Enterprise M9000 Server."
"Note that the Sun SPARC Enterprise M9000 and Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise"
"M9000 are electrically equivalent."
