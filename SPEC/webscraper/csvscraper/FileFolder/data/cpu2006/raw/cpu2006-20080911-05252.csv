"The config file option 'submit' was used."
" taskset was used to bind processes to cores except"
" for 436.cactusADM peak"
" For peak modules using 1/2 the number of available cores, copies"
" were each assigned to a single L2 cache using mysubmit.pl script."
" See the flags description file for mysubmit.pl details."

"Operating System Notes"

" 'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set the stacksize to unlimited prior to run"
" OMP_NUM_THREADS set to number of cores"
" KMP_AFFINITY set to physical,0"
