"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
" numactl was used to bind copies to the cores"
" Tmpfs filesystem set up with:"
"  mkdir -p /mnt/shm"
"  mount -t tmpfs -o rw,mpol=interleave tmpfs /mnt/shm/"
" The mpol=interleave option sets the NUMA"
" memory allocation policy for all files to allocate"
" from each node in turn."
"Operating system file is ext3"
"Spec benchmark is copied from hard disk ext3 to tmpfs"
"Binaries were compiled with huge pages enabled"
"but huge pages were not used"

"Platform Notes"


"System is composed of 4 modules with 32 DIMMs on each module."

"General Notes"

" The Bull novascale bullion and"
" the Bull bullx S6030 models are electronically equivalent."
" The results have been measured on a novascale bullion model."
" Binaries were compiled on RHEL5.5"
