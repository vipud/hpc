" Processes are bound to CPUs using taskset."

" limit stacksize unlimited"

" Memory system is in ""Non Mirror Mode""."

" The following 2 environment variables were set"
"     MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_=0"
"     MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_=-1"
" This will cause use of sbrk() calls instead of"
" mmap() calls to get memory from the system."
