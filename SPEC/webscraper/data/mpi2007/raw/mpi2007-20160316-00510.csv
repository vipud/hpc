"Job Placement:"
"  Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set"
"  of nodes, i.e. the minimal needed number of leaf switches"
"  was used for each job: 1 switch for up to 32 sockets, and"
"  2 switches for up to 64 sockets."

"Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"  The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"  with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"  I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic is"
"  restricted to the other plane."
