"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."

"General Notes"

"  MPI startup command:"
"    mpiexec.hydra command was used to start MPI jobs."
"  Software environment:"
"    export I_MPI_COMPATIBILITY=3"
"    export I_MPI_FABRICS=shm:tmi"
"    export I_MPI_HYDRA_PMI_CONNECT=alltoall"
"  Network:"
"    Endeavour Omni-Path fabric consists of 48-port switches = 24 core switches"
"    connected to each leaf of the rack switch."
"  Job placement:"
"    Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set of nodes, i.e."
"    the minimal needed number of leaf switches was used for each job = 1 switch"
"    for 40/80/160/320/640 ranks, 2 switches for 1280 and 1980 ranks."
"  IBM Platform LSF was used for job submission. It has no impact on performance."
