"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"For peak benchmarks that used 2048 MPI ranks, four ranks"
"were assigned to each CPU chip, leaving 2 cores per chip idle."

"General Notes"

" Software environment:"
"   export MPI_REQUEST_MAX=65536"
"   export MPI_TYPE_MAX=32768"
"   export MPI_BUFS_THRESHOLD=1"
"   export MPI_IB_RAILS=2"
"   ulimit -s unlimited"

" BIOS settings:"
"   AMI BIOS version 080016"
"   Hyper-Threading Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology activated in the OS via"
"     /etc/init.d/acpid start"
"     /etc/init.d/powersaved start"
"     powersave -f"

" Job Placement:"
"   In the base run, each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact"
"   set of nodes, i.e. the minimal needed number of switches was"
"   used for each job: 2 switches for 96 ranks,"
"   4 switches for 192 ranks, 8 switches for 384 ranks,"
"   16 switches for 768 ranks, 32 switches for 1536 ranks,"
"   and 64 switches for 3072 ranks."

" Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"   The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"   with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"   I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic can"
"   use both planes."
