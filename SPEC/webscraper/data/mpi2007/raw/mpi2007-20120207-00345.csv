"General Notes"

" Software environment:"
"   export MPI_REQUEST_MAX=65536"
"   export MPI_TYPE_MAX=32768"
"   export MPI_BUFS_THRESHOLD=1"
"   export MPI_IB_RAILS=2"
"   ulimit -s unlimited"

" BIOS settings:"
"   AMI BIOS version 2.0"

" Job Placement:"
"   In the base run, each MPI job is assigned to a topologically compact"
"   set of nodes, i.e. the minimal needed number of switches was"
"   used for each job: 2 switch for up to 256 ranks, 4 switches"
"   for 512 ranks."

" Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"   The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"   with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"   I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic can"
"   use both planes."

"   SGI manufactures its own switch blades using unmodified Mellanox"
"   switch ASICs. The test system has SGI QDR_1.5_HYPR_2454 switch"
"   with Mellanox 36-port QDR Infiniband switch Device 48438"
"   (InfiniScale IV)."
