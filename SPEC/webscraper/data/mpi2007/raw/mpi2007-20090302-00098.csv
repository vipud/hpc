"The config file option 'submit' was used."

"General Notes"

"BIOS settings notes:"
"  Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (SMT): Disabled (default is Enabled)"
"  Intel Turbo Boost Technology (Turbo)  : Enabled (default is Enabled)"

"RAM configuration notes: compute nodes have"
"  1x2-GB and 1x1-GB RDIMM on each memory channel,"
