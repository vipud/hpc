"General Notes"

" Software environment:"
"   export MPI_REQUEST_MAX=65536"
"   export MPI_TYPE_MAX=32768"
"   export MPI_IB_RAILS=2"
"   ulimit -s unlimited"

" BIOS settings:"
"   AMI BIOS version DY2E6044"
"   Hyper-Threading Technology disabled"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology activated with"
"     modprobe acpi_cpufreq"
"     cpupower frequency-set -u 2601MHz -d 2601MHz -g performance"

" Job Placement:"
"   Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set"
"   of nodes, i.e. the minimal needed number of switches was"
"   used for each job: 2 switches for up to 192 ranks,"
"   4 switches for up to 384 ranks, 8 switches for 768 ranks,"
"   and 16 switches for 1536 ranks."

" Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"   The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"   with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"   I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic can"
"   use both planes."
