"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."

"General Notes"

" MPI startup command:"
"   mpirun command was used to start MPI jobs."
"   eth0 (10 GigE) was specified at the mpirun command line for MPI message passing"
"   eth3 (1 GigE) was specified for non-MPI communication."
" BIOS settings:"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology (Turbo)  : Enabled (the default)"

" RAM configuration:"
"   Each compute node has 64x8-GB RDIMMs."

" Network:"
"   Four compute nodes connect to one Cisco Nexus 7018 switch"
"   via 10 GigE port."

" Job placement:"
"   Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set of nodes, i.e."
"   the minimal needed number of compute nodes was used for each job:"
"   2 compute nodes for 64 ranks, 4 compute nodes for 128 ranks."

" PBS Pro was used for job submission. It has no impact on performance."
