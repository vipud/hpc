"Job Placement:"
"  Twenty ranks were assigned to each CPU chip, leaving 2"
"  cores per chip idle.   Each MPI job was assigned to a"
"  topologically compact set of nodes, i.e. the minimal"
"  number of leaf switches was used for each job: 1 switch"
"  for up to 32 sockets, and 2 switches for up to 64 sockets."

"Additional notes regarding interconnect:"
"  The Infiniband network consists of two independent planes,"
"  with half the switches in the system allocated to each plane."
"  I/O traffic is restricted to one plane, while MPI traffic is"
"  restricted to the other plane."
