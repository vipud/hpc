" Job Placement:"
"   Each MPI job is assigned to a topologically compact"
"   set of nodes, i.e. the minimal needed number of switches was"
"   used for each job: 1 switch for up to 192 ranks, 2 switches"
"   for 384 ranks, 4 switches for 768 ranks, 8 switches for"
"   1536 ranks and 16 switches for 3072 ranks."

" Peak run:"
"   In the peak run, some benchmarks used different number of ranks"
"   from base. It is the only difference between base and peak."
