"The config file option 'submit' was used."

"General Notes"

"BIOS settings notes:"
"  Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (SMT): Disabled (default is Enabled)"
"  Intel Turbo Boost Technology (Turbo)  : Disabled (default is Enabled)"

"RAM configuration notes: compute nodes have"
"  1x2-GB and 1x1-GB RDIMM on each memory channel,"
"  2-GB RDIMM is closer to the CPU."

"Network notes: nine 36-port switches, 3 core switches and 6 leaf switches."
"  Each leaf has 6 links to each core. Remaining 18 ports on 5 of 6 leafs are"
"  used for compute nodes. On the sixth leaf 8 ports are used for FS nodes,"
"  remaining 10 ports are open."

"PBS Pro was used for job submission. It has no impact on performance."
