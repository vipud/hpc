"General Notes"

" Software environment:"
"   setenv MPI_REQUEST_MAX 65536"
"     Determines the maximum number of nonblocking sends and"
"     receives that can simultaneously exist for any single MPI"
"     process.  MPI generates an error message if this limit"
"     (or the default, if not set) is exceeded.  Default:  16384"
"   setenv MPI_TYPE_MAX 32768"
"     Determines the maximum number of data types that can"
"     simultaneously exist for any single MPI process."
"     MPI generates an error message if this limit (or the default,"
"     if not set) is exceeded.  Default:  1024"
"   setenv MPI_BUFS_THRESHOLD 1"
"     Determines whether MPT uses per-host or per-process message"
"     buffers for communicating with other hosts.  Per-host buffers"
"     are generally faster but for jobs running across many hosts they"
"     can consume a prodigious amount of memory.  MPT will use per-"
"     host buffers for jobs using up to and including this many hosts"
"     and will use per-process buffers for larger host counts."
"     Default:  64"
"   setenv MPI_DSM_DISTRIBUTE"
"     Activates NUMA job placement mode.  This mode ensures that each"
"     MPI process gets a unique CPU and physical memory on the node"
"     with which that CPU is associated.  Currently, the CPUs are"
"     chosen by simply starting at relative CPU 0 and incrementing"
"     until all MPI processes have been forked."

"   limit stacksize unlimited"
"     Removes limits on the maximum size of the automatically-"
"     extended stack region of the current process and each"
"     process it creates."
" PBS Pro batch scheduler (www.altair.com) is used with"
"   placement sets to ensure each MPI job is assigned to"
"   a topologically compact set of nodes"
" BIOS settings:"
"   AMI BIOS version 8.15"
"   Hyper-Threading Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology enabled (default)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology activated in the OS via"
"     /etc/init.d/acpid start"
"     /etc/init.d/powersaved start"
"     powersave -f"
