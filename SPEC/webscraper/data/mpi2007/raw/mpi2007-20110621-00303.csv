"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"For peak benchmarks that used 2048 MPI ranks, four ranks were assigned"
"to each CPU die, leaving two cores per die idle."

"General Notes"

" Software environment:"
"   export MPI_REQUEST_MAX=65536"
"   export MPI_TYPE_MAX=32768"
"   export MPI_BUFS_THRESHOLD=1"
"   ulimit -s unlimited"

" BIOS settings:"
"   AMI BIOS version 1.0a"

" Job Placement:"
"   In the base run, each MPI job is assigned to a topologically compact"
"   set of nodes, i.e. the minimal needed number of switches was"
"   used for each job: 1 switch for up to 192 ranks, 2 switches"
"   for 384 ranks, 4 switches for 768 ranks, 8 switches for"
"   1536 ranks and 16 switches for 3072 ranks."
