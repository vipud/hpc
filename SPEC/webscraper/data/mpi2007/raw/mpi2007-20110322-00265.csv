"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."

"General Notes"

" MPI startup command:"
"   mpiexec.hydra command was used to start MPI jobs."

" BIOS settings:"
"   Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (SMT): Disabled (default is Enabled)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology (Turbo)  : Disabled (default is Enabled)"

" RAM configuration:"
"   Compute nodes have 2x8-GB RDIMM on each memory channel."

" Network:"
"   Forty six 36-port switches: 18 core switches and 28 leaf switches."
"   Each leaf has one link to each core. Remaining 18 ports on 25 of 28 leafs"
"   are used for compute nodes. On the remaining 3 leafs the ports are used"
"   for FS nodes and other peripherals."

" Job placement:"
"   Each MPI job was assigned to a topologically compact set of nodes, i.e."
"   the minimal needed number of leaf switches was used for each job: 1 switch"
"   for 40/80/120/160 ranks."

" PBS Pro was used for job submission. It has no impact on performance."
