"General Notes"

" MPI startup command:"
"   mpirun command was used to start MPI jobs. This command starts"
"   an independent ring of mpd daemons, launches an MPI job, and shuts"
"   down the mpd ring upon the job termination."

" BIOS settings:"
"   Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (SMT): Disabled (default is Enabled)"
"   Intel Turbo Boost Technology (Turbo)  : Enabled (default is Enabled)"

" RAM configuration:"
"   Compute nodes have 6x4-GB dual rank DDR3-1333 RAM."
"   Head node has 4x2GB single rank DDR2-667 RAM."

" Network:"
"   Head node and all compute nodes are interconnected by 1GB Ethernet and"
"   QDR Infiniband. Each interconnect type has one single switch."
