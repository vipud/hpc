"Compiler Invocation Notes"


" Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
" http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12_patches.jsp"
" The tested configuration included patch 124867-02, 124861-04, 124863-01"

" Peak also uses ""GCC for SPARC Systems"", which combines gcc"
" with the Sun Code Generator for SPARC systems.  It is invoked"
" as ""gcc"", and accepts source code compatible with GCC 4.2."
" For more information, including support, see"
"      http://cooltools.sunsource.net/gcc/"

"Operating System Notes"


" Processes were bound to cores using ""submit"" and ""pbind""."
" A processor set was created using"
"   psrset -c 1-63"
" and the runspec process was placed into the set using"
"   psrset -e 1"

" ulimit -s 131072 was used to allow the stack to grow"
" up to 131072 KB (aka 128 MB).  Note that saying ""131072"""
" is preferable to ""unlimited"", because there is a tradeoff"
" between space for the stack vs. space for the heap."

" The Sun Blade T6320 is supported by Solaris 10 8/07"
" plus a factory-installed set of patches.  As tested, the"
" system used a 15 January 2008 pre-release build of the"
" patch set."

" /etc/system parameters"
"    autoup = 600"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."
"    tune_t_fsflushr = 10"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."

" The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"
