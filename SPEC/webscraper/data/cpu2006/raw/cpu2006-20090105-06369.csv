" 'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set the stacksize to unlimited prior to run"
" OMP_NUM_THREADS set to number of cores"
" KMP_AFFINITY set to ""physical,0"""
" KMP_STACKSIZE set to 200M"

"Platform Notes"

" This Express5800/320Fd-LR is a fault-tolerant server."
" Two modules are installed in this server."
" Each module physically has ""2CPU chips,12GB memory"", The total physical configuration"
" is ""4CPU chips,24GB memory""."
" Using fault-tolerant lockstep technology, these two modules communicate with each other"
" and execute the same instructions at the same time, The operating system only sees"
" ""2CPU chips,12GB memory"" as the other components add only redundancy and do not"
" contribute to any performance benefit."

"General Notes"

" The NEC Express5800/320Fd-LR(Intel Xeon E5405) and"
" the Bull NovaScale R630 E1 LR(Intel Xeon E5405, 2.00 GHz) models are electronically equivalent."
" The results have been measured on a NEC Express5800/320Fd-LR(Intel Xeon E5405) model."
