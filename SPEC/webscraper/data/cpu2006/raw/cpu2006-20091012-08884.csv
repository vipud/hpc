"The Apache C++ Standard Library V4.2.1 was installed from"
"   http://stdcxx.apache.org/download.html using:"
"     alias gmake=specmake"
"     gmake BUILDTYPE=8d CONFIG=sunpro.config"

"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used.  Processes were assigned to"
"specific processors using 'pbind' commands.  The list of processors to use"
"was provided in the 'BIND' variable, to generate the pbind commands."
"(For details, please see the config file.)"

"Operating System Notes"


"Shell Environments:"
