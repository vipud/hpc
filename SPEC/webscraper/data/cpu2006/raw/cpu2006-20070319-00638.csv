"'start /b /wait /affinity' command is used to bind CPU(s) to processors."
"The Windows command ""start /b /wait /affinity <hex_affinity_mask> application"""
"  starts the specified application without creating a new window (/b)"
"  and waits for its termination (/wait). Only the processors specified"
"  in <hex_affinity_mask> are allowed to execute the application."
"  See the Windows documentation for the description of other parameters"
"  of the start command."
