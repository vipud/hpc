"Operating System Notes"

" Basic System has 32 cores / 64 threads"
" VMware vSphere 5 is the hypervisor"
" Bullion is booted, then configured to create"
" one virtual machine with 32 virtual CPUs and 256GB of memory"
" RHEL 6.1 runs in this big Virtual Machine"
" Each virtual CPU of the Virtual Machine uses 1 of the 2 threads"
" of a physical core."
" So the big Virtual Machine uses the 32 physical cores."
" 32 threads remain unused (available for VMware use)"
" They are the second hyperthread of each physical core."
