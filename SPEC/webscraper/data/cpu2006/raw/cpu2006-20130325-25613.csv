"      gmake BUILDTYPE=8d CONFIG=sunpro.config"

"Submit Notes"

" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind' commands."
" The config file option 'submit' was used, along with a list of"
" processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate the pbind commands."
" (For details, please see the config file.)"

"Operating System Notes"

" Shell Environments:"
"    ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed by the stack"
"    (and therefore make more space available to the heap)."

"    The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using svcadm disable webconsole."

" System Tunables:"
" (/etc/system parameters)"
