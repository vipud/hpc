"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"'numactl' was used to bind copies to the cores."
"See the configuration file for details."

"Operating System Notes"

"'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set environment stack size"
"'ulimit -l 2097152' was used to set environment locked pages in memory limit"

"runspec command invoked through numactl i.e.:"
"numactl --interleave=all runspec <etc>"

"Set dirty_ratio=8 to limit dirty cache to 8% of memory"
"Set swappiness=1 to swap only if necessary"
"Set zone_reclaim_mode=1 to free local node memory and avoid remote memory"
"sync then drop_caches=3 to reset caches before invoking runcpu"

"Transparent huge pages were enabled for this run (OS default)"

"Set vm/nr_hugepages=57344 in /etc/sysctl.conf"
"mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/hugepages"

"Platform Notes"

"The Linux run level was 3; sysinfo run-level is incorrect."
