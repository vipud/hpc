"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"the start command with /affinity was used to bind copies to cores"

"General Notes"

" System can be built with an extended ATX case like SuperChassis"
" 743TQ-865B-SQ and an 885W power supply."
" This result is a 32-bit result and the -DSPEC_CPU_WIN64 portability flag"
" for 471.omnetpp is not required.  However, this portability flag did not"
" affect the generated code since one needs -DSPEC_CPU_P64 defined for the"
" -DSPEC_CPU_WIN64 flag to have any effect."
" Given that the use of -DSPEC_CPU_WIN64 did not affect the generated code,"
" SPEC has decided to allow this publication but will disallow future"
" publications that use this flag for a 32-bit submission."
