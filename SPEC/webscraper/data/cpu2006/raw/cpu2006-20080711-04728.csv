"Compiler Invocation Notes"

"Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
"    http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12_patches.jsp"

"Submit Notes"


"Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind' commands.  The config"
"file option 'submit' was used, along with a list of processors in the 'BIND'"
"variable, to generate the pbind commands.  (For details, please see the config file.)"


"Operating System Notes"


"Environment Variable Settings:"

"The maximum number of threads a program can create was set with:"
"    OMP_NUM_THREADS=32"

"Program threads were bound to processors with:"
"    SUNW_MP_PROCBIND=""0-31"""

"Behavior of parallel threads was set with:"
"    SUNW_MP_THR_IDLE=SPIN"
"SPIN specifies that an idle thread should spin while waiting at barrier"
"or waiting for new parallel regions to work on."

"ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed"
"    by the stack (making more space available for the heap)"

"System Tunables (/etc/system parameters):"

tune_t_fsflushr=10
"    Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"    page flush daemon, fsflush."
autoup=600
"    Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"    be written by fsflush."
bufhwm=3000
"    Memory byte limit for caching I/O buffers"
segmap_percent=1
"    Set maximum percent memory for file system cache"

"Other System Settings:"

"The webconsole service was turned off using"
"    svcadm disable webconsole"


"Platform Notes"


"Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
"the same capacity DIMMs."

"This result is measured on a Sun SPARC Enterprise M4000 Server."
"Note that the Sun SPARC Enterprise M4000 and Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise"
"M4000 are electrically equivalent."
