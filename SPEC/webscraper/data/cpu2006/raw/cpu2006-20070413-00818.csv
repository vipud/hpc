"Operating System Notes"


"Processes were bound to cores using ""submit"" and ""pbind""."

"These shell commands request use of local 4MB pages:"
"      export LD_PRELOAD=madv.so.1:mpss.so.1"
"      export MPSSHEAP=4MB"
"      export MPSSSTACK=4MB"
"      export MADV=access_lwp"
"'access_lwp' means that the next light weight"
"process to touch the specified address range"
"will access it the most heavily."

"ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space"
"consumed by the stack (and therefore make more"
"space available to the heap)."

"""CMU"" = CPU/Memory Unit; each holds 2 or 4 CPU chips."

"Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
