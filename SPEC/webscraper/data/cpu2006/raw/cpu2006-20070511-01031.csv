"Operating System Notes"

" 'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set the stacksize to unlimited prior to run"
" '/usr/bin/taskset' used to bind processes to CPUs"

"General Notes"


" The system bus runs at 1067 MHz"

" All binaries were built with 32-bit Intel compiler except:"
" 401.bzip2, 456.hmmer and 462.libquantum in peak were built with"
" 64-bit Intel compiler by changing the path for include and library files."

" BIOS configuration:"
" Adjacent Sector Prefetch = Disable"

" This result was measured on the PRIMERGY RX300 S3. The PRIMERGY RX300 S3 and"
" the PRIMERGY TX300 S3 are electronically equivalent."
