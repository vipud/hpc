"Compiler Invocation Notes"

"  Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 is distributed with mandatory OS patches"
"   118683-05  119963-20  120753-08"
"  Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 and patches are available at"
"   http://oracle.com/goto/solarisstudio"


"Submit Notes"


"  Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind'"
"  commands.  The config file option 'submit' was used, along"
"  with a list of processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate"
"  the pbind commands.  (For details, please see the config file.)"


"Operating System Notes"

"  ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space"
"  consumed by the stack (and therefore make more"
"  space available to the heap)."

"System Tunables:"
"(/etc/system parameters)"

"    tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."
"    autoup=600"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."
"    bufhwm=3000"
"       Memory byte limit for caching I/O buffers."
"    segmap_percent=1"
"       Set maximum percent memory for file system cache."

"Other System Settings:"

"    The ""webconsole"" service was turned off using"
"        svcadm disable webconsole"

"Platform Notes"


"  Memory is 2-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
"  the same capacity DIMMs."

" This result is measured on a SPARC Enterprise M3000 server from"
" Fujitsu.  The SPARC Enterprise M3000 server from Oracle and from"
" Fujitsu are electrically equivalent."
