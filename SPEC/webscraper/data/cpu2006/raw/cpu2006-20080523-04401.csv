"Operating System Notes"

" 'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set the stacksize to unlimited prior to run"
"  OMP_NUM_THREADS set to number of cores"

"Platform Notes"

"This Express5800/320Fc-MR is a fault-tolerant server."
"Two modules are installed in this server and each module has ""2CPU chips,12GB memory"","
"so total ""4CPU chips,24GB memory"" are on this server."
"With lockstep technology, these two modules communicate each other"
"and handle the same instructions at the same time,"
"then logically the ""CPU,Memory"" is recognized as ""2CPU chips,12GB memory"" by the OS."

"General Notes"

"All benchmarks compiled in 32-bit mode except 401.bzip2,"
"456.hmmer, for peak, are compiled in 64-bit mode"

" The NEC Express5800/320Fc-MR(Intel Xeon X5355) and"
" the Bull NovaScale R630 (Intel Xeon X5355,2.66GHz) models are electronically equivalent."
" The results have been measured on a NEC Express5800/320Fc-MR(Intel Xeon X5355) model."
