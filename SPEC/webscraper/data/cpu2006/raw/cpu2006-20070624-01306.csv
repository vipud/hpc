"Operating System Notes"

" 'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set the stacksize to unlimited prior to run"
" '/usr/bin/taskset' used to bind processes to CPUs"

"General Notes"


" The system bus runs at 1333 MHz"
" All binaries were built with 32-bit Intel compiler except:"
" 401.bzip2, 456.hmmer and 462.libquantum in peak were built with"
" 64-bit Intel compiler by changing the path for include and library files."

" The Express5800/120Rg-1 and the Express5800/120Ri-2 models are"
" electronically equivalent."
" The results have been measured on a Express5800/120Ri-2 model."
