"Compiler Invocation Notes"

" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 is distributed with mandatory OS patches"
"  118683-05  119963-20  120753-08"
" Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 and patches are available at"
"  http://oracle.com/goto/solarisstudio"

"The Apache C++ Standard Library V4.2.1 was installed from"
"   http://stdcxx.apache.org/download.html using:"
"     alias gmake=specmake"
"     gmake BUILDTYPE=8d CONFIG=sunpro.config"

"Submit Notes"


" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind'"
" commands.  The config file option 'submit' was used, along"
" with a list of processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate"
" the pbind commands.  (For details, please see the config file.)"


"Operating System Notes"


" ulimit -s 131072 was used to allow the stack to grow"
" up to 131072 KB (aka 128 MB).  Note that saying ""131072"""
" is preferable to ""unlimited"", because there is a tradeoff"
" between space for the stack vs. space for the heap."


" System Tunables (/etc/system parameters):"

" tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"     Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"     page flush daemon, fsflush."
" autoup=600"
"     Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"     be written by fsflush."

" Other System Settings:"

" The webconsole service was turned off using"
"     svcadm disable webconsole"


"Platform Notes"


" Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling all slots with"
" the same capacity DIMMs."

" This result is measured on a SPARC Enterprise M4000 server from"
" Fujitsu.  The SPARC Enterprise M4000 server from Oracle and from"
" Fujitsu are electrically equivalent."
