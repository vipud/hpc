"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
" taskset was used to bind processes to cores except"
" for 462.libquantum peak"

"Operating System Notes"

" 'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set the stacksize to unlimited prior to run"
" OMP_NUM_THREADS set to number of cores"
" KMP_AFFINITY set to ""physical,0"""
" KMP_STACKSIZE set to 64M"

"Platform Notes"

" This Express5800/320Fd-MR is a fault-tolerant server."
" Two modules are installed in this server."
" Each module physically has ""1CPU chips,24GB memory"", The total physical configuration"
" is ""2CPU chips,48GB memory""."
" Using fault-tolerant lockstep technology, these two modules communicate with each other"
" and execute the same instructions at the same time, The operating system only sees"
" ""1CPU chips,24GB memory"" as the other components add only redundancy and do not"
" contribute to any performance benefit."

"General Notes"

" The NEC Express5800/320Fd-MR(Intel Xeon E5450) and"
" the Bull NovaScale R630 E1 MR(Intel Xeon E5450, 3.00 GHz) models are electronically equivalent."
" The results have been measured on a NEC Express5800/320Fd-MR(Intel Xeon E5450) model."
