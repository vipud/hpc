"General Notes"


" This result was measured on the Acer Altos R520."
" The Altos R720 and Altos R520 are electronically equivalent."

" All benchmarks compiled in 32-bit mode except 401.bzip2 and 456.hmmer,"
" for peak, are compiled in 64-bit mode"
" BIOS Settings"
"   Hardware Prefetcher set to OFF"

"   Adjacent Cache Line Prefetch set to OFF"

" All results but peak 462.libquantum used taskset to bind"
" processes to cores."
" ""ulimit -s unlimited"" was set for stacksize unlimited"
" OMP_NUM_THREADS set to number of cores"
