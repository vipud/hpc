"Compiler Invocation Notes"

"Sun Studio compiler patches are available at"
"   http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/patches/ss12u1_patches.jsp"

"The Apache C++ Standard Library V4.2.1 was installed from"
"   http://stdcxx.apache.org/download.html using:"
"     alias gmake=specmake"
"     gmake BUILDTYPE=8d CONFIG=sunpro.config"

"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used.  Processes were assigned to"
"specific processors using 'pbind' commands.  The list of processors to use"
"was provided in the 'BIND' variable, to generate the pbind commands."
"(For details, please see the config file.)"

"Operating System Notes"


"Shell Environments:"

"    The maximum number of threads a program can create was set with:"
"       OMP_NUM_THREADS=64"

"    Program threads were bound to processors with:"
"       SUNW_MP_PROCBIND="" 1  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34"

"    Behavior of parallel threads was set with:"
"       SUNW_MP_THR_IDLE=SPIN"
"    SPIN specifies that an idle thread should spin while waiting at barrier"
"    or waiting for new parallel regions to work on."

"    ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed"
"       by the stack (making more space available for the heap)"

"System Tunables:"
"(/etc/system parameters)"

"    tune_t_fsflushr=10"
"       Controls how many seconds elapse between runs of the"
"       page flush daemon, fsflush."
"    autoup=300"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to"
"       be written by fsflush."
"    bufhwm=3000"
"       Memory byte limit for caching I/O buffers."
"    segmap_percent=3"
"       Set maximum percent memory for file system cache."
"    lpg_alloc_prefer=1"
"       Set lgroup page allocation to strongly prefer local pages."

"Other System Settings:"

"    The webconsole service was turned off using svcadm disable webconsole."

"Platform Notes"


" Memory is 8-way interleaved by filling each CMU's slots with the same"
" capacity DIMMs."

" This result is measured on a Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise M8000 Server."
" Note that the Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise M8000 and Sun SPARC Enterprise"
" M8000 are electrically equivalent."
