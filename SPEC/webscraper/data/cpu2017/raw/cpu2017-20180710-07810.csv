"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."

"See the configuration file for details."

"Operating System Notes"

"'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set environment stack size"
"'ulimit -l 2097152' was used to set environment locked pages in memory limit"

"numactl --interleave=all runspec <etc>"

"Set dirty_ratio=8 to limit dirty cache to 8% of memory"
"Set swappiness=1 to swap only if necessary"
"Set zone_reclaim_mode=1 to free local node memory and avoid remote memory"
"sync then drop_caches=3 to reset caches before invoking runcpu"
"Linux governor set to performance with cpupower ""cpupower frequency-set -r -g performance"""
"dirty_ratio, swappiness, zone_reclaim_mode and drop_caches were"
"all set using privileged echo (e.g. echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness)."
"Transparent huge pages were enabled for this run (OS default)"
"Huge pages were not configured for this run."
"IRQ balance service stopped using ""systemctl stop irqbalance.service"""
"Tuned profile set with ""tuned-adm profile throughput-performance"""
"Speculative Store Bypass (CVE-2018-3639) mitigation was disabled system-wide"
"via kernel boot parameter ""spec_store_bypass_disable=off"""
"Benchmark was conducted on a pre-release kernel (Kernel 4.4.131-94.25-default) which has the"
"same performance as the release version (Kernel 4.4.131-94.29-default)"
