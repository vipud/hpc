"Submit Notes"

" Processes were assigned to specific processors using 'pbind' commands."
" The config file option 'submit' was used, along with a list of"
" processors in the 'BIND' variable, to generate the pbind commands."
" (For details, please see the config file.)"

"Operating System Notes"

" Shell Environments:"
"    ulimit -s 131072 was used to limit the space consumed by the stack"
"    (and therefore make more space available to the heap)."

"    The ""Logical Domains Manager"" service was turned off using the command ""svcadm disable ldmd""."

" System Tunables:"
" (/etc/system parameters)"
"    autoup = 86400"
"       Causes pages older than the listed number of seconds to be written by fsflush."
"    doiflush = 0"
"       Controls whether file system metadata syncs will be executed during fsflush invocations."
"    dopageflush = 0"
"       Controls whether memory is examined for modified pages during fsflush invocations."
"    zfs:zfs_arc_max=1073741824"
"       Determines the maximum size of the ZFS Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC)."

"General Notes"

" The Building Block (BB) is just a Fujitsu SPARC M12-2S that is the basic"
" unit to be expanded as if stacking up children's blocks."

" File System:"
"  tmpfs: output_root was used to put run directories in /tmp/cpu2017"
"  zfs: operating system"

" Binaries were compiled on a system with 2x SPARC64 XII CPU + 1TB Memory using Oracle Solaris 11.3 SRU 24.4"


"Platform Notes"

" Firmware Settings:"
" (XSCF operations)"
"    Set High Speed Mode via XSCF command ""sethsmode -s on""."
