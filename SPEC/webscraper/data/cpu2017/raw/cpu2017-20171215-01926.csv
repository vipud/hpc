"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"'numactl' was used to bind copies to the cores."
"See the configuration file for details."

"Operating System Notes"

"'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set environment stack size"
"'ulimit -l 2097152' was used to set environment locked pages in memory limit"

"runspec command invoked through numactl i.e.:"
"numactl --interleave=all runspec <etc>"

"Set dirty_ratio=8 to limit dirty cache to 8% of memory"
"Set swappiness=1 to swap only if necessary"
"Set zone_reclaim_mode=1 to free local node memory and avoid remote memory"
"sync then drop_caches=3 to reset caches before invoking runcpu"

"dirty_ratio, swappiness, zone_reclaim_mode and drop_caches were"
"all set using privileged echo (e.g. echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness)."

"Transparent huge pages were enabled for this run (OS default)"

"Huge pages were not configured for this run."

"Binaries were compiled on a system with 2x AMD EPYC 7601 CPU + 512GB Memory using RHEL 7.4"

"jemalloc, a general purpose malloc implementation, was obtained at"
https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases/download/4.5.0/jemalloc-4.5.0.tar.bz2
"jemalloc was built with GCC v4.8.5 in RHEL v7.2 under default conditions."
"jemalloc uses environment variable MALLOC_CONF with values narenas and lg_chunk:"
"  narenas: sets the maximum number of arenas to use for automatic multiplexing"
"           of threads and arenas."
"  lg_chunk: set the virtual memory chunk size (log base 2). For example,"
"            lg_chunk:21 sets the default chunk size to 2^21 = 2MiB."

"The AOCC Gold Linker plugin was installed and used for the link stage."

"The AOCC Fortran Plugin version 1.0 was used to leverage AOCC optimizers"
"with gfortran. It is available here:"
