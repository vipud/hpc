"Submit Notes"

"The config file option 'submit' was used."
"'numactl' was used to bind copies to the cores."
"See the configuration file for details."

"Operating System Notes"

"'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set environment stack size"
"'ulimit -l 2097152' was used to set environment locked pages in memory limit"

"runspec command invoked through numactl i.e.:"
"numactl --interleave=all runspec <etc>"

"Set dirty_ratio=8 to limit dirty cache to 8% of memory"
"Set swappiness=1 to swap only if necessary"
"Set zone_reclaim_mode=1 to free local node memory and avoid remote memory"
"sync then drop_caches=3 to reset caches before invoking runcpu"

"dirty_ratio, swappiness, zone_reclaim_mode and drop_caches were"
"all set using privileged echo (e.g. echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness)."

"Transparent huge pages were enabled for this run (OS default)"

"Huge pages were not configured for this run."

"with gfortran. It is available here:"
"Binaries were compiled on a system with 2x AMD EPYC 7601 CPU + 512GB Memory using RHEL 7.4"

"jemalloc, a general purpose malloc implementation, was obtained at"

"jemalloc was built with GCC v4.8.5 in RHEL v7.2 under default conditions."
"jemalloc uses environment variable MALLOC_CONF with values narenas and lg_chunk:"
"  narenas: sets the maximum number of arenas to use for automatic multiplexing"
"           of threads and arenas."
"  lg_chunk: set the virtual memory chunk size (log base 2). For example,"
"            lg_chunk:21 sets the default chunk size to 2^21 = 2MiB."
