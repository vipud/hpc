"Submit Notes"

" The numactl mechanism was used to bind copies to processors. The config file option 'submit'"
" was used to generate numactl commands to bind each copy to a specific processor."
" For details, please see the config file."

"Operating System Notes"

" Stack size set to unlimited using ""ulimit -s unlimited"""
" Transparent Huge Pages enabled by default"
" Prior to runcpu invocation"
" Filesystem page cache synced and cleared with:"
" sync; echo 3 >       /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
"  runcpu command invoked through numactl i.e.:"
" numactl --interleave=all runcpu <etc>"
" IRQ balance service was stopped using ""systemctl stop irqbalance.service"""
" Tuned-adm profile was set to Throughput-Performance using ""tuned-adm profile throughput-performance"""
" Numa Balancing disabled using ""echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing"""
" VM Dirty ratio was set to 40 using ""echo 40 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio"""

" The result, as tested, used kernel 4.4.131-94.25-default of SLES12 SP3. This is a pre-production kernel"
" which should be representative of the production kernel 4.4.131-94.29.1 for SLES12 SP3."
